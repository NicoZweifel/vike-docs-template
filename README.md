A template to easily deploy content that has been authored with [`MDX`](https://mdxjs.com/).

### Getting started

- Clone the repository or create a repository from the template.
- `pnpm i`
- `pnpm dev`

### Security

MDX is javascript. If not carefully done, solutions that are evaluating user content can enable XSS attacks.
