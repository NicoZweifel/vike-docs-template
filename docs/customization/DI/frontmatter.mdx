description: Change how frontmatter is processed
---

Frontmatter can be manipulated by passing a `FrontmatterProcessor` in [`options.ts`](/configuration).

```ts
export type FrontmatterProcessor = (
  cwd: string,
  file: string,
  baseRoute: string,
  frontmatter: UnknownFrontMatter
) => void;
```
