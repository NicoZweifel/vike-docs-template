Custom component and snippet imports are fully supported and automatically bundled in parallel with [`mdx-bundler`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) and [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/).

<Warning>
Be careful when adding imports, bundling additional dependencies can significantly increase the bundle size.
</Warning>

### Global Components

Global `MDX` components can be added in `mdxComponents.tsx`

```ts {2}
export const mdxComponents: MDXComponents = {
  // add or change components
};
```

### Layout

The layout is defined in `Layout.tsx` and can easily be changed by either configuring the `tailwindcss` container class or changing the layout components or `Layout.tsx` itself.
