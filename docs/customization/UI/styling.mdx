Adjusting or adding styles is required to implement a custom style or theme.

<Info>
Check out [`vanilla-extract`](https://vanilla-extract.style/) or [`styleX`](https://stylexjs.com/) if you desire a more type-safe, maintainable and scalable styling solution or check [here](https://vike.dev/tailwind-css) for a more comprehensive list of options.
</Info>

#### Global CSS

Add or import global `CSS` in `index.css` or `Layout.tsx`.

```css {7,8,9} showLineNumbers
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* add css */

.example {
  background: black;
}
```

#### Tailwind

Extend the `tailwind.config` or replace as much as required with another styling solution, some recommendations have been made [above](#styling).

#### Theming

Light/Dark mode with a class based approach is implemented but no theme colors are configured.

#### Prism Themes

This template is using [`rehype-prism-plus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-prism-plus) and [`prism-themes`](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).
Adjust the settings in `options.ts` and the `Prism` theme css import in `Layout.tsx` as needed.

```
import './index.css';
import 'prism-themes/themes/prism-vsc-dark-plus.css';
```
