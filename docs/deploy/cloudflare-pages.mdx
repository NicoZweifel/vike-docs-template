description: Deploying the project to Cloudflare Pages

To deploy to `Cloudflare Pages`, connect your `Github` account to `Cloudflare`.

## Create Project

- Create a new Pages project with the following Build & deployment settings:

| Key                    | Value                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build command          | `npx pnpm i --store=node_modules/.pnpm-store && npm run build` |
| Build output directory | `/dist/client`                                                 |
| Root directory         | `/`                                                            |

It should look like this on `Cloudflare`:

`pnpm` is used in this project, so we'll have to bypass `npm i` on `Cloudflare` by setting an environment variable in the pages project:

```
NPM_FLAGS=--version
```

## Done!

Deploy by pushing your commits to `Github`!
