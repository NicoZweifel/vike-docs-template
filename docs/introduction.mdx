### Notes

- Author mdx files in a `docs` folder or with [any file pattern](/start/setup#options).
- File and frontmatter based routing
- Import any Component or Snippet in your documents, all files will be bundled in parallel with [`mdx-bundler`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) and [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/).
- No bloat - just the basics with a focus on only adding light-weight dependencies.
- A Perfect lighthouse score.
- 100% static output, resulting in a very easy and blazingly fast deployment to [`GitHub Pages`](https://pages.github.com/), [`Cloudflare Pages`](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), [`Vercel`](https://vercel.com/), [`AWS`](https://aws.amazon.com/) and many other hosting providers.
- Uses [`vike`](https://vike.dev/) + [`preact`](https://preactjs.com/) and [`tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a tiny bundle size.
- [`Unpic`](https://unpic.pics/) to handle Images.
