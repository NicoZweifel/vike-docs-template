- Clone the repository or create a repository from the template.
- `pnpm i`
- `pnpm dev`
- Start editing `MDX` content!

## Notes

- Author mdx files in a `docs` folder or with [any file pattern](/configuration#options).
- File and frontmatter based routing
- A Perfect lighthouse score.
- Easy [Deployment](/deploy)
- 100% static output, resulting in a very easy and blazingly fast deployment to [`GitHub Pages`](https://pages.github.com/), [`Cloudflare Pages`](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), [`Vercel`](https://vercel.com/), [`AWS`](https://aws.amazon.com/) and many other hosting providers.
- Full support for custom components and snippets. Import anything in your documents, all files will be bundled in parallel with [`mdx-bundler`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) and [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/).
- Unopinionated styling. Easily add [Global CSS](/customization/ui/styling#global-css), a custom [`tailwind`](/customization/ui/styling#tailwind) config or other [styling solutions](/customization/ui/styling).
- No bloat - just the basics with a focus on only adding light-weight dependencies.
- Easy to add analytics, search or other third party implementations.
- Uses [`vike`](https://vike.dev/) + [`preact`](https://preactjs.com/) and [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a tiny bundle size.
- [`Unpic`](https://unpic.pics/) to handle Images.
- [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) and [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/) configuration for automatic linting and formatting of files, including [`MDX`](https://mdxjs.com/) documents and Code blocks.
