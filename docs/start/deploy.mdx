The example docs are hosted on [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Cloudflare Pages

- Connect `Cloudflare` with `Github`.
- Create a new Pages project with the following Build & deployment settings:

| Key                    | Value                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build command          | `npx pnpm i --store=node_modules/.pnpm-store && npm run build` |
| Build output directory | `/dist/client`                                                 |
| Root directory         | `/`                                                            |

It should look like this on `Cloudflare`:

<img
  src="/cloudflare_pages_settings.png"
  width={800}
  alt="cloudflare_pages_settings"
/>

`pnpm` is used in this project, so we'll have to bypass `npm i` on `Cloudflare` by setting an environment variable in the pages project:

```bash
NPM_FLAGS=--version
```

### Done!

Deploy by pushing your commits to `Github`!

## Other Providers

Deploying to most cloud providers is a matter of a few clicks.

Check the `DEPLOY` section of `vike`'s [docs](https://vike.dev/github-pages) for more information about hosting providers.
