## Other Providers

Deploying to most cloud providers is a matter of a few clicks.

Check the `DEPLOY` section of `vike`'s [docs](https://vike.dev/github-pages) for more information about hosting providers.

## Security

MDX is javascript. If not carefully done, solutions that are evaluating user content can enable XSS attacks.
Make sure the content is trusted or the dev and build environments are isolated and/or protected if you are planning to evaluate user content.
