## Options

Configure the name, repository and license and `rehype`/`remark` plugins.
For convenience, you can re-use the fields in `package.json`, if they are defined.

```ts {4-6} showLineNumbers
import packageJsonFile from './package.json';

const options: BundleMDXOptions = {
  name: packageJsonFile.name,
  repository: packageJsonFile.repository,
  license: packageJsonFile.license,
  // other options
};

export default options;
```

## Bring your own!

Use-case specific configurations and implementations are kept to a minimum. Adding additional solutions is recommended.
