## Options

Configure the name, repository and license and `rehype`/`remark` plugins.
For convenience, you can re-use the fields in `package.json`, if they are defined.

```ts {4-6,8-13} showLineNumbers
import packageJsonFile from './package.json';

const options: BundleMDXOptions = {
  name: packageJsonFile.name,
  repository: packageJsonFile.repository,
  license: packageJsonFile.license,
  // other options
  mdxBundlerOptions: {
    mdxOptions: {
      jsxImportSource: 'preact',
      remarkPlugins: [
        /* add or change remark plugins*/
      ],
      rehypePlugins: [
        /* add or change rehype plugins*/
      ],
    },
  },
};

export default options;
```

### Layout

The layout is defined in `Layout.tsx` and can easily be changed by either configuring the `tailwindcss` container class or changing the layout itself.

### Global CSS

Add or import global `CSS` in `index.css` or `Layout.tsx`.

### Prism Themes

This template is using [`rehype-prism-plus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-prism-plus) and [`prism-themes`](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).
Adjust the settings in `options.ts` and the `Prism` theme css import in `Layout.tsx` as needed.

## Bring your own!

Use-case specific configurations and implementations are kept to a minimum. Adding your own solutions is recommended.

### Styling

Adjusting styles and components as needed is required to implement a custom style or theme.
Check out [`vanilla-extract`](https://vanilla-extract.style/) or [`styleX`](https://stylexjs.com/) if you desire a more type-safe, maintainable and scalable styling solution or check [here](https://vike.dev/tailwind-css) for a more comprehensive list of options.

#### Theming

Light/Dark mode with a class based approach works but theme colors are not configured.

#### Tailwind

Extend the `tailwind.config` or replace as much as required with another styling solution, some recommendations have been made [above](#styling).

#### Global CSS

Add global css to `index.css`

```css {7,8,9} showLineNumbers
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* add css */

.example {
  background: black;
}
```

### MDX Components

Add global mdx components in mdxComponents.tsx

```ts {2}
export const mdxComponents: MDXComponents = {
  // add or change components
};
```
