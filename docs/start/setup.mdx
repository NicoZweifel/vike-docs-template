## Options

Configure the name of the project and other settings like `rehype`/`remark`.

```ts
const options: BundleMDXOptions = {
  name: 'vike-docs-template',
  pattern: '**/*.mdx',
  // other options
  mdxBundlerOptions: {
    mdxOptions: {
      jsxImportSource: 'preact',
      remarkPlugins: [
        /* add or change remark plugins*/
      ],
      rehypePlugins: [
        /* add or change rehype plugins*/
      ],
    },
  },
};

export default options;
```

## Bring your own!

Use-case specific configurations and implementations are kept to a minimum. Adding your own solutions is recommended.

### Styling

Adjusting styles and components as needed is required to implement a custom style or theme.
Check out [`vanilla-extract`](https://vanilla-extract.style/) or [`styleX`](https://stylexjs.com/) if you desire a more type-safe, maintainable and scalable styling solution.

#### Theming

Light/Dark mode with a class based approach works but theme colors are not configured.

#### Tailwind

Extend the `tailwind.config` or replace as much as required with another styling solution, some recommendations have been made [above](#styling).

#### Global CSS

Add global css to `index.css`

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* add css */

.example {
  background: black;
}
```

### MDX Components

Add global mdx components in mdxComponents.tsx

```ts
export const mdxComponents: MDXComponents = {
  // add or change components
};
```
